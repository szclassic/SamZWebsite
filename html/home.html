                <p>My name is Sam Zandiasadabadi, and I am 23 years old from San Francisco Bay Area!</p>
                <p>I am a Software Developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly applications. In May 2024, I graduated from San Francisco State University with a <a href="https://www.parchment.com/u/award/55097d7608c71b71e3225a88acc73874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #007bff;">Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</a> with focus on Software Development and Mathematics. 
                    I am also an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #007bff;">AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional</a>!</p>
                <p>Prior to attending SFSU, I was a student-athlete at Las Positas Community College, where in addition to completing my transfer requirements, I also played for the <a href="https://athletics.laspositascollege.edu/sports/msoc/2020-21/roster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #007bff;">Eagle's Men Soccer</a> team intercollegiately, 
                    as well as being the President of the <a href="https://www.laspositascollege.edu/clubs/assets/active_club_listining_archives/Student%20Clubs%20Spring%202021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #007bff;">Chess Club</a> on campus simultaneously! During my time at LPC, I was part of the Dean's Academic Honors List twice, and also got inducted in the <a href="https://www.nsls.org/home?mrasn=1414897.1757447.QnLbDvIG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #007bff;">National Society of Leadership and Success</a>!</p>
                <p>While in SFSU, I made the Dean's List on two separate occasions for academic excellence! Additionally, I was part of the Men's Club Soccer team, where I was able to travel to places like San Jose, Sacramento, and various other cities to compete in tournaments. I also competed in the SFSU Intramurals Sports Program, where I created my own team "Raven FC" with my friends, and competed in various sports, winning four trophies in my four semesters in SFSU!
                    My time in SFSU came to an end in May 2024, after receiving my Bachelor's Degree, as well as being inducted in the <a href="../picture/PLFP.png" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff;">President's Leadership Fellows Program</a>!</p>
